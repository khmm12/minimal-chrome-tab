> When the default new tab already pissed you off

# Motivation 

One day I noticed that the default new tab consumes resources even it's not active. Rediciolous! 

# Advantages

- Lightweight 🪶
- Light/dark mode support 🌓
- Nice look 💅
- It doesn't do anything when is not active 🔋
- Blazing fast ⚡️
- No analytics and spyware 🕵️‍♂️

# How to build and install the extension

To build the extension, use the following command:

After that, you can install the extension by loading the unpacked extension from the `dist` folder. [More information](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).
